# Recruitment task for AppUnite Elixir backend developer.

Imagine you are a backend developer entrusted with developing a "Pharmacy" epic.

Pharmacies in this epic don't oparate in an environment of "sell with profit or die", because they are not independent institutions. In this epic by "pharmacy" we mean an in-hospital pharmacy. Such pharmacy should NOT sell drugs to cliens, but rather freely disburse them to the doctors. Such pharmacies have a periodic budgeting they must fit within. Because of that, pharmacies should keep tight grip of how much they are able to purchase from the vendors.

#### The task

You are now entrusted with writing a logic for periodic budget increase for each existing pharmacy. After you're done each pharmacy should has its budget increased by 2500 each day.

#### Notes

* You are free to edit anything in the project.
* Please don't pay attention to :prod environment. Imagine this is a pre-release project and all production settings are planned for a far future.
* Please test your work, but you don't need to test if a function is run each day. Testing just the function contests is fine.
* Bonus point if you create a pull request (or many pull requests) with your work, but merging to the main is also fine.
* Have a nice day :smiley:!
